# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction project predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient health data. Using factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other medical parameters, the system leverages machine learning techniques to identify individuals at high or low risk. Early detection can help in timely medical intervention and preventive care.

## Features
- Predicts the likelihood of heart disease.
- Analyzes key health metrics such as:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Blood Pressure
  - Cholesterol Levels
  - Heart Rate
  - Chest Pain Type
  - Fasting Blood Sugar
  - Electrocardiogram Results
- Uses machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- Provides a simple interface for inputting patient data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- (Optional) Web Interface: Flask / Streamlit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd heart-disease-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Enter patient health data in the interface.

Get prediction results indicating high or low risk of heart disease.

Dataset
The project uses the Heart Disease Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle.
